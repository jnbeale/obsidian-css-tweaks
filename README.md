A few tweaks and fixes to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)'s CSS. 

I have tested them in versions up to `0.9.6`.

Tweaks that I have done myself:

- Cleaner links: use different colors for internal and external links, remove ![](https://publish.obsidian.md/public/images/fdc86034ba18de3558c8fa414a58f9e8.svg) image from external ones
- Cleaner blockquotes: a vertical line instead of a closed box
- Cleaner embeds: tigher padding, no margins, no borders
- Better colors for `<mark>` tag: both in light and dark themes

Features that I have gotten from others:

- [Good-looking checkboxes](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/nicer-checkboxes/2238)
- [Pills for tags](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978/13)
- [On/off auto fading for UI controls](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978/10)
- [Cleaner embeds by removing YAML's front matter](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978/41)
